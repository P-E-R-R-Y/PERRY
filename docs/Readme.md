## Description

This project is a engine, and the goal is to build it like, it will be able to use any library like (sfml/raylib..) to build an app/game.

For Epitech guys who have work on some project knows as Arcade,Rtype, I want to combine all those projects to build the engine who can help you make all your C/CPP software project in 2days.

# PERRY

## Project

I want to build a engine, with a lot of specs. It will implement cross-platform, network udp/tcp, multimedia library (abstraction, replication, ), game engine,

## Engine

My goal is to build the reliable project I ever made combining everything I learn & everything I want to understand better..

## Runtime

My goal should be to implement runtime loading function.
to run a library a game as an arcade gameplay using my ecs I want to make any game possible to build.

## Reliable

My project should be the most stable possible

## YAML

I want to use .yml to setup the library.

# Plan d'Action

- [ ] Build an interface of a multimedia library
- [ ] Build an abstraction of the librarie
- [ ] Build it dynamically
- [ ] Make it cross plateform
- [ ] Make it work on 32/64 & inversed bite type.

# Engine

## ECS (entity component system)

This engine will implement the ECS from rtype with my add-ons.

## CBD (component based design)

I want to add a cbd system over the ECS. but I'm not realy sure about that.

# Multimedia

## Window

### Event

### Camera

## Graphics

### Model2

### Model3

### Text

## Audio

### Music

### Sound

# About

## Developer

Firstly it's a personal work but in the future if I work with other devs, you should check this [Developer.md](docs/Developer.md).

## Setup

Secondly if you want to install the library to build your game you should folow this [Setup.md](docs/Setup.md)
